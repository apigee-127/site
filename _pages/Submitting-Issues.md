The support model for Apigee-127 tools is a Community-based support model.  Apigee does not offer paid support for the Apigee-127 toolkit at this time.  We do, however, encourage you to open an issue in GitHub that we intend to address - but there are no guaranteed SLAs.

However, Apigee does support [Node.js applications deployed onto Apigee Edge](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/overview-nodejs-apigee-edge), which is Apigee's paid cloud offering.  If you are an Apigee Edge customer you can use the [standard support channel](https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support) including the support portal.

If you are not an Apigee Edge customer you can request help as described on the [Apigee Support](https://community.apigee.com/content/apigee-customer-support) page of our [Apigee Community](https://community.apigee.com/) site.
