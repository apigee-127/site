# a127 reference

This is the installation guide and command reference for `a127`, the command-line interface for Apigee 127. Note that the `/bin/a127` command must be in your PATH. See the "Installation" section for details.

# Prerequisites

If you choose to install Apigee-127 using npm you will need npm version 1.3 or higher.  You will also need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) version 0.10.24 or higher.

# Installation

You can install `apigee-127` either through npm or by cloning and linking the code from GitHub.  This document covers the installation details for installing from npm.

## Installation from npm

The `apigee-127` module and its dependencies are designed for Node.js and is available through npm using the following command:

### Linux / Mac from a Terminal Window:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g apigee-127
```

> NOTE: The npm installation requires permission to create a folder in the ~/.a127 directory. When installing apigee-127 you may need to add the flag --unsafe-perm to the install command. For example:
    ```bash
        $sudo npm install -g apigee-127 --unsafe-perm
    ```

> NOTE: `sudo` may be required with the `-g` option which places the `a127` command-line commands in you PATH. If you do not use `-g`, then you need to add the `apigee-127/bin `directory to your PATH manually.
>
> Typically, the `-g` option places modules in: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/apigee-127` on *nix-based machines.


### Windows, from a Command Prompt

```
npm install -g apigee-127
```

## Location of files

Apigee-127 places most of its files that it depends on at a global level in `~/.a127`.  This includes an `accounts` file that has details about the configured accounts and an optional `usergrid` directory if you choose to download and use Usergrid through the `a127` command line.

## Dependencies

For a list of dependencies and Node.js modules that are relevant to an Apigee-127 project, see [Apigee-127 modules](https://github.com/apigee-127/a127-documentation/wiki/Apigee-127-modules)

# <a name="a127-project"></a>project

Create and manage Apigee 127 projects on your local machine.

`$ a127 project [options]  [command]`

**Examples:**

`$ a127 project create`

`$ a127 project start`

`$ a127 project deploy`

To print a list of valid options for a command:

`$ a127 project [command] -h`

**Commands:**

* **create** - Creates a new Apigee 127 skeleton project populated with files from GitHub. See also "New Apigee 127 project structure" below.

* **start** - Runs the main Node.js project file, app.js. The server automatically restarts when you make changes to the project.
```bash
    Options:
        -h, --help   output usage information
        -d, --debug  start in debug mode
        -m, --mock   start in mock mode
        -o, --open   open in browser
        -a, --account <account> use the specified account for configuration
        -d, --debug [port]      start in remote debug mode
        -b, --debug-brk [port]  start in remote debug mode, wait for debugger connect

    Options:
        -h, --help               output usage information
        -a, --account [account]  use specified account
        -i, --import-only        import project to provider, but don't deploy (Apigee only)
        -n, --name [name]        override deployment name
        -m, --main [main]        override deployment main file
        -b, --base [path]        override deployment base path (default is /projectName)
```

>Note: When you deploy your project to Apigee Edge, Node.js modules are installed or updated automatically for you on Edge. The command does not upload any files from your local `node_modules` directory.


* **undeploy** - Undeploys the project from the currently configured cloud platform account.
```bash
    Options:

       -a, --account [account]  use specified account
       -n, --name [name]        override deployment name
```

# <a name="a127-account"></a>account

Create and manage deployment provider accounts. Deployment providers are cloud-based platforms where you can deploy your Apigee 127 project.

>**Note:** Currently, the only option is deploying to Apigee Edge. Other providers will be added in the future.

`$ a127 account [-options]  [command]  {account_name}`

**Example:**

`$ a127 account create myaccount`

To print a list of valid options for a command:

`a127 account [command] -h`

Account information for each account that you configure is stored by default in `~/.a127/accounts`. The default provider is `apigee`.

```bash
    -h, --help                         output usage information
    -p, --provider [provider]          name of provider

# <a name="a127-usergrid"></a>usergrid

Manage an [Apache Usergrid](http://usergrid.incubator.apache.org/) service on your local machine. Usergrid is an open-source BaaS solution based on RESTful APIs.

`$ a127 usergrid [options]  [command]`

>**Note:** You can change the default Cassandra port for Usergrid. The default is 7000. To change it, edit the file: `~/.a127/usergrid/tmp/cassandra.yaml`

Examples:

`$ a127 usergrid start`

`$ a127 usergrid portal`

`$ a127 usergrid stop`

To print a list of valid options for a command:

`$ a127 usergrid [command] -h`

**Commands:**

* **start** - Starts a local instance of the Apache Usergrid service.
* **stop** - Stops the running Usergrid service.

    Note: If you are unsure if Usergrid is running, hit localhost:8080. If you get a "Page Not Found" error, Usergrid is not running. In that case, try stopping and then starting Usergrid using `a127 usergrid stop` and `a127 usergrid start`.

* **download** - Downloads Apache Usergrid to your machine.
* **portal** - Opens the Usergrid portal. Use the portal to manage Usergrid projects, create data sets, manage app security, and more. The default login credentials are test/test.
