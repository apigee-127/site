## About the "quick start" example

Apigee-127 projects all follow a pattern similar to the "hello world" implementation described in [Quick start](https://github.com/apigee-127/a127-documentation/wiki/Quick-start). The quick start example lays down a project structure that includes a Swagger API specification (in YAML format), an implemented controller JavaScript file, and a base Node.js app. Let's look at these pieces one by one:

### Quick start project structure

The project files are cloned directly from the `https://github.com/apigee-127/project-skeleton` repository on GitHub. This skeleton project contains all the files and internal wirings needed for a basic Apigee-127 project.

{% highlight shell %}

    hello-world-api
        /api
            /controllers
                hello_world.js
            /swagger
                swagger.yaml
        /config
            index.js
            default.yaml
        app.js
        package.json
        README.md
{% endhighlight %}


### The Swagger 2.0 API Model

You will find the API model in `api/swagger/swagger.yaml`. This file conforms to the Swagger 2.0 specification, which models API behavior in a standard way, and enables tooling that lets you model, test, and document your API on the fly.

**Note:** YAML is a data serialization/representation standard. If you're new to YAML, check out [www.yaml.org](http://www.yaml.org). Another excellent introduction is the [Wikipedia YAML entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

From the `hello-world` folder, execute:

    `a127 project edit`

This command launches the interactive Swagger editor, which loads the project's `swagger.yaml` file.

Here is the entire hello-world app Swagger model. It conforms to the Swagger 2.0 specification, which is documented [here](https://github.com/reverb/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). You'll notice there are several Apigee-127 specific extensions (`x-swagger-router-controller`, etc.) included in the model. These extensions are explained below.

                $ref: "#/definitions/ErrorResponse"
    definitions:
      HelloWorldResponse:
        required:
          - message
        properties:
          message:
            type: string
      ErrorResponse:
        required:
          - message
        properties:
          message:
            type: string
{% endhighlight %}

#### The 'paths' object and Swagger extensions

The `paths:`  object specifies the API's resource paths, HTTP verb, query parameters, and more.

The `x-swagger-router-controller` extension maps a path to a controller file, where the HTTP operation's logic is implemented. For example, in the hello world app, the path `/hello` maps to a controller file `controller/hello_world.js`:

{% highlight yaml %}
    paths:
      /hello:
        x-swagger-router-controller: hello_world
        x-volos-authorizations: {}
        x-volos-apply: {}
        get:
          description: "Returns 'Hello' to the caller"
          operationId: hello
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** The extension `x-swagger-router-controller` is a custom Apigee-127 extension to the Swagger model.

### Controller files

When a request is received, Apigee-127 looks at the endpoint (`/hello`) and routes the request to a controller file. In this example, the `controller/hello_world.js` implementation retrieves a query parameter sends back a "hello world" response to the caller:

{% highlight javascript %}
    function hello(req, res) {
      var name = req.swagger.params.name.value;
      var hello = name ? util.format('Hello, %s', name) : 'Hello, stranger!';
      res.json(hello);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

### The main Node.js app and Apigee-127 middleware

The main `app.js` is a simple Express app consisting of these six lines:
```javascript
    'use strict';
    var a127 = require('a127-magic');
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    app.use(a127.middleware());
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 10010);
```
The `a127-magic` module loads several Apigee-127 middleware modules. These modules perform tasks like Swagger specification validation, endpoint routing, and volos configuration:

   * a127-magic
      * swagger-tools
         * middleware
            * swagger-metadata.js
            * swagger-router.js
            * swagger-validator.js
      * volos-swagger
         * lib
            * connect-middleware.js
      * js-yaml
      * underscore

Let's look at the middleware components:

* [swagger-tools](https://www.npmjs.org/package/swagger-tools)
Provides middleware functions for:
      * swagger-metadata -- Provides Swagger configuration metadata to downstream middleware components.
      * swagger-router -- Uses Swagger middleware metadata to route requests to controllers.
      * swagger-validator - Uses Swagger information to validate API requests before they are routed to controllers.

* [volos-swagger](https://github.com/apigee-127/volos/tree/master/swagger)
Lets you configure volos features like caching and OAuth directly in the Swagger model file. For example, this stanza configures the volos "in memory" caching feature for your API.
```yaml
        x-volos-resources:
            cache:
            provider: "volos-cache-memory"
            options:
                - "memCache"
                - ttl: 10000
```
Similarly, you could configure caching using Redis or Apigee. Refer to the [volos-swagger](https://github.com/apigee-127/volos/tree/master/swagger) documentation for more information.

The pattern:
```javascript
    var a127 = require('a127-magic');
    app.express=require('express');
    var app = express();
    app.use(a127.middleware());
```
is all you need to add this support to your application. Behind the scenes, the "wiring" and interaction is driven through the Swagger configuration file. The basic programming model is:

1. Model your API using the Swagger editor. Define the API endpoints, request verbs, and optionally add features like volos-based caching, quota management, and OAuth.
2. Implement controllers to handle each request endpoint.
3. Drive, test, and document your API with the Swagger editor.
